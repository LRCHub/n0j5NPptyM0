They take us away from Africa
With the intention to steal our culture
The good father passed by and say, "Humble yourself, my children
Humble yourself, my little one
Humble yourself"

Oh, my brothers, it is
Wadada, oh-oh-oh, wadada

Where is your love, Jamaica?
Where is your love, Jamaica?
I can't see your love
I can't feel your love
No even touch your love
I don't know about your love

(Ooh-ooh, wadada) wadada mean love in Africa (wadada)
Take us away from Africa
With the intention to steal our culture (wada)
